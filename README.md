1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way that I found in making sure that my programs are both functional and secure is by having a list of requirements and as I code, make sure that each section in the functionality is hit. As I go into programming, I make sure to hit all my key points and in order to keep it secure I make sure to use proper coding practices. Afterwards I use black box testing by going in depth and making sure that each aspect of the code is secured.

2) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret a user's needs by trying to put myself in their shoes. I vision myself and try to see what I would want out of the program and what features would be the most beneficial to me as a user. I then make a list and then view it as a developer into what would be the most practical and realistic needs that I can incorporate into the program.

3) How do I approach designing software?

 I approach software design in a practical manner. I like to view it like a river that flows. I want my program to flow smoothly without any ripples or currents. This type of mentality shows in my design by how each section is structured and flows from one section to another. But I try to make sure that it's not rigid and always open to change for the benefit of either the user or the program itself.
